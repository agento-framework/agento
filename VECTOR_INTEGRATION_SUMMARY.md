## 💡 Usage Patterns

### 1. Development Setup
```typescript
// Quick start with in-memory storage
const vectorStorage = VectorStorageFactory.createInMemory(embeddingProvider);
const knowledgeBase = new VectorKnowledgeBaseImpl(vectorStorage, embeddingProvider);
```

### 2. Production Setup
```typescript
// Environment-driven configuration
const vectorStorage = VectorStorageFactory.create(); // Uses env vars
const agent = new Agent({
  states,
  contexts,
  tools,
  vectorKnowledgeBase: knowledgeBase
});
```

### 3. Tool Integration
```typescript
agent.registerTool("search_knowledge", async ({ query, concepts }) => {
  const results = await knowledgeBase.hybridSearch(query, concepts);
  return { results, relatedConcepts: await knowledgeBase.findRelatedConcepts(concepts) };
});
```
