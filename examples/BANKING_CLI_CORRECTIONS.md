# Banking CLI Implementation Corrections

## Overview
This document summarizes the corrections made to `examples/comprehensive-bank-cli.ts` to properly align with the Agento framework's architecture and best practices.

## Key Corrections Made

### 1. Context Structure (Proper Knowledge-Based Design)

**Before**: Contexts were conversational and duplicative
```typescript
{
  key: "banking_expert",
  content: `You are a professional banking expert with comprehensive knowledge of:
- Account management (checking, savings, business, credit accounts)
- Transaction processing and validation
...`
}
```

**After**: Contexts are structured knowledge bases
```typescript
{
  key: "banking_expert", 
  content: `BANKING OPERATIONS EXPERTISE:

Account Types & Management:
- Checking accounts: Transaction accounts for daily banking, minimum balance requirements
- Savings accounts: Interest-bearing accounts, withdrawal limitations, higher minimum balances
...`
}
```

**Rationale**: Contexts should contain factual knowledge, data, and expertise that helps the agent, not conversational prompts.

### 2. System Prompts (Not Conversational Responses)

**Before**: Prompts were conversational responses
```typescript
{
  key: "banking_hub",
  prompt: "You are SecureBank AI Assistant. I provide comprehensive banking services with the highest security standards. How can I help you today?"
}
```

**After**: Prompts are system-level instructions
```typescript
{
  key: "banking_hub", 
  prompt: "You are a professional banking AI assistant with comprehensive knowledge of banking operations, regulations, and security protocols. Always prioritize customer security, regulatory compliance, and accurate financial information."
}
```

**Rationale**: Prompts should be system instructions for the AI, not user-facing messages.

### 3. Inheritance Model (Eliminating Duplication)

**Before**: Child states duplicated parent contexts and tools
```typescript
{
  key: "account_services",
  contexts: ["banking_expert", "security_protocols"], // Duplicating parent
  tools: ["verify_account", "get_account_balance", ...] // Many duplicate tools
}
```

**After**: Child states add only their specific contexts/tools
```typescript
{
  key: "account_services",
  contexts: ["account_operations"], // Only specific addition
  tools: ["get_account_balance", "get_account_details", "list_customer_accounts"] // Focused tools
}
```

**Rationale**: The framework handles inheritance automatically. Child states inherit all parent contexts and tools.

### 4. Specialized Contexts for Different Areas

**New Context Structure**:
- `banking_expert`: Core banking knowledge and regulations
- `account_operations`: Specific account management procedures  
- `transaction_knowledge`: Transaction processing and analysis
- `reporting_knowledge`: Financial reporting and statement generation
- `security_protocols`: Security and compliance procedures

**Rationale**: Breaking down knowledge into specialized areas makes the system more modular and ensures relevant expertise is available at appropriate levels.

### 5. Tool Organization and Descriptions

**Before**: Tools had basic descriptions
```typescript
{
  name: "get_account_balance",
  description: "Get current account balance"
}
```

**After**: Tools have detailed, security-conscious descriptions
```typescript
{
  name: "get_account_balance", 
  description: "Get current account balance with security verification"
}
```

**Rationale**: Better descriptions help the LLM understand when and how to use tools appropriately.

### 6. Hierarchical State Design

**New State Hierarchy**:
```
banking_hub (root)
├── account_services
│   ├── account_inquiry
│   │   ├── balance_inquiry (leaf)
│   │   ├── account_overview (leaf)
│   │   └── account_list (leaf)
│   ├── account_management
│   │   ├── account_settings (leaf)
│   │   ├── account_status (leaf)
│   │   └── account_maintenance (leaf)
│   └── account_verification (leaf)
├── transaction_services  
│   ├── transaction_history (leaf)
│   └── transfer_services (leaf)
├── reporting_services
│   ├── statement_generation (leaf)
│   ├── spending_analysis (leaf)
│   └── document_export (leaf)
└── customer_support
    ├── profile_management (leaf)
    ├── issue_resolution (leaf)
    └── product_information (leaf)
```

### 7. Account Number Validation

**New Feature**: The system now properly handles cases where users don't provide account numbers:

- **Proactive Prompting**: When account operations are requested without specifying an account, the agent asks which account
- **Account Listing**: Users can request to see all their accounts first
- **No Assumptions**: The system never assumes which account a customer wants to access
- **Clear Guidance**: Specific prompts guide users to provide required information

**Examples**:
- User: "Check my balance" → Agent: "Which account would you like me to check the balance for?"
- User: "What accounts do I have?" → Agent lists all accounts with masked numbers
- User: "Account details" → Agent: "For which account number would you like details?"

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Focused leaf states with specific purposes
- Proper inheritance from root to leaves
- Logical grouping of related functionality

### 8. Context Priority System

**Priority Hierarchy**:
- `banking_expert` (100): Core banking knowledge
- `security_protocols` (95): Critical security information
- `account_operations` (90): Account-specific procedures (enhanced with account number requirements)
- `transaction_knowledge` (85): Transaction processing
- `reporting_knowledge` (80): Reporting and analysis

**Rationale**: Higher priority contexts are more likely to be included when token limits are reached.

### 9. Enhanced Tools

**New Tool Added**:
- `get_customer_accounts_by_session`: Gets all accounts for the current authenticated user when no specific account is provided

**Enhanced Account Operations Context**:
- Added explicit account number requirement guidelines
- Included customer interaction scripts for common scenarios
- Specified when to ask for account numbers vs. when to list accounts

## Framework Compliance Checklist

✅ **Contexts are knowledge-based, not conversational**
✅ **Prompts are system instructions, not user responses**  
✅ **Child states inherit parent contexts/tools automatically**
✅ **No duplication of contexts/tools across hierarchy**
✅ **Clear separation between different expertise areas**
✅ **Proper leaf state design for intent analysis**
✅ **Tool descriptions are detailed and purposeful**
✅ **Priority system for context selection**

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Knowledge Separation**: Different types of banking knowledge are separated into focused contexts
2. **Inheritance Utilization**: Parent state capabilities flow down to children automatically
3. **Security First**: Security protocols are embedded at the root level and inherited everywhere
4. **Focused Leaf States**: Each leaf state has a clear, specific purpose for intent matching
5. **Tool Organization**: Tools are grouped by functional area and described comprehensively

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test that leaf states properly inherit all parent contexts and tools
2. Verify that intent analysis can correctly identify appropriate leaf states
3. Confirm that security protocols are enforced across all operations
4. Test tool availability at different state levels
5. Validate that context priority affects LLM behavior appropriately

This corrected implementation now properly follows the Agento framework's architecture and should provide more robust, secure, and maintainable banking services.
