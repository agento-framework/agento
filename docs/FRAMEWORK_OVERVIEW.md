# Agento Framework v2 - Complete Technical Documentation

## üöÄ Framework Overview

Agento is a sophisticated, production-ready agentic AI framework designed for building intelligent conversational agents with advanced state management, context orchestration, and seamless integration capabilities. The framework provides a robust architecture for creating AI agents that can handle complex business logic, maintain conversation context, and integrate with external systems.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

Agento follows these fundamental principles:

1. **Intent-Driven Architecture**: Every user interaction is routed through an intelligent intent analysis system
2. **State-Based Design**: Agents are organized as hierarchical state machines with inheritance
3. **Context Orchestration**: Dynamic, AI-powered context management that evolves with conversation flow
4. **Modular Components**: Pluggable architecture for LLMs, storage, vector databases, and tools
5. **Production-Ready**: Built for scale with persistence, error handling, and monitoring

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### 1. Agent Core (`Agent`)
The central orchestrator that coordinates all framework components:
- **State Machine Management**: Hierarchical state routing and inheritance
- **Intent Analysis**: LLM-powered routing to appropriate states
- **Tool Execution**: Parallel and sequential tool calling with error handling
- **Context Orchestration**: Dynamic context selection and management
- **Conversation Persistence**: Long-term memory and session management

### 2. State Machine System (`StateMachine`)
Hierarchical state management with powerful inheritance:
- **Additive Inheritance**: Child states inherit and extend parent capabilities
- **Guard Functions**: Security and access control with `onEnter`/`onLeave` guards
- **Leaf State Routing**: Automatic routing to terminal states for processing
- **Dynamic Resolution**: Runtime resolution of inherited properties

### 3. Context Orchestration (`ContextOrchestrator`)
The "Scanning Ball" system for intelligent context management:
- **Multi-Source Context**: Conversation, knowledge base, temporal, and cultural contexts
- **Relevance Scoring**: AI-powered relevance assessment and ranking
- **Pattern Learning**: Continuous learning from interaction patterns
- **Token Optimization**: Intelligent context selection within token limits

### 4. LLM Abstraction (`LLMProvider`)
Universal LLM interface supporting multiple providers:
- **Multi-Provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq with unified API
- **Tool Calling**: Standardized tool calling across all providers
- **Configuration Override**: Per-state LLM configuration
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and fallbacks

### 5. Vector Integration (`VectorStorage`)
Pluggable vector database abstraction:
- **Multiple Databases**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, in-memory
- **Embedding Providers**: OpenAI, HuggingFace, Jina, Ollama
- **Semantic Search**: Knowledge base integration with RAG
- **Hybrid Search**: Combined vector and keyword search

### 6. Conversation Management (`ConversationManager`)
Advanced conversation persistence and context optimization:
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Semantic, temporal, and relevance-based history
- **Storage Abstraction**: Support for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, hybrid
- **Context Optimization**: Automatic token management and summarization
- **Cross-Session Search**: Search across multiple conversations

### 7. Tool Execution (`ToolExecutor`)
Comprehensive tool management and execution:
- **Parallel Execution**: Concurrent tool calling for performance
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and reporting
- **Type Safety**: Schema validation for tool parameters
- **Built-in Tools**: Temporal, external integration, and utility tools

## üåü Key Features

### State-Based Intent Routing
```typescript
const states: StateConfig[] = [
  {
    key: "customer_service",
    description: "Customer service operations",
    prompt: "You are a helpful customer service agent",
    children: [
      {
        key: "order_inquiry",
        description: "Handle order questions",
        tools: ["check_order_status"],
        onEnter: async ({ metadata }) => metadata.authenticated === true
      }
    ]
  }
];
```

### Context Orchestration
The framework's "Scanning Ball" intelligently selects relevant context:
- Analyzes user queries for concepts and intent
- Scans conversation history for patterns
- Searches knowledge bases for relevant information
- Assesses tool relevance dynamically
- Learns from interaction patterns

### Guard Functions & Security
```typescript
{
  key: "admin_panel",
  onEnter: async ({ userQuery, metadata }) => {
    return metadata.userRole === "admin";
  },
  onLeave: async ({ userQuery, metadata }) => {
    await auditLog.log(userQuery, metadata.userId);
    return true;
  }
}
```

### Multi-LLM Support
```typescript
// Different LLMs for different capabilities
{
  key: "creative_writing",
  llmConfig: { provider: "openai", model: "gpt-4", temperature: 0.9 },
  children: [{
    key: "technical_analysis", 
    llmConfig: { provider: "anthropic", model: "claude-3-sonnet", temperature: 0.3 }
  }]
}
```

### Advanced Tool Integration
```typescript
// Built-in temporal tools
await agent.processQuery("What time is it in Tokyo next Tuesday?");

// Custom business tools
agent.registerTool("process_payment", async ({ amount, method }) => {
  return await paymentProcessor.charge(amount, method);
});
```
